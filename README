|- COMPILING -|
The provided Makefile will build the required libraries,
    as well as it will build the two executables "runsim"
    and "testsim".
Simply run "make" and the two  executables will be outputted.
    See the USAGE section below to see how to run the programs.
A cleaning function is provided. run "make clean" to clean up
	the directory and leave only src behind.
Make will also output the liblog.a static archive into the
    libs directory. This is used for the logging functionality
    and is a slightly modified version of project 1.


|- USAGE -|
The executables use shared memory between them to simulate
    a licensing system. 

The runsim executable takes 1 required argument:
[n] Specifies the number of subprocesses you wish to simulate
    at one time.
-h Shows a help menu.

You should also provide a file with commands listed line by line 
    as standard in to runsim.
    This should look like the following:

    testsim -t # #
    where -t specifies the sleep time inbetween logging outputs and
    the plain # is the number of times it will send a message to 
    the log.

The testsim excutable is run by runsim. It takes 2 required arguments:
[-t s] Specifies time in seconds between messages logged to file.
[n] Specifies number of times a message will be logged.
-h Shows a help menu.


|- FUNCTIONALITY -|
The runsim executable will spawn multiple children of testsim each one
    using a license. If the licenses run out we will wait until a child
    exits and returns the license. 
Access of the critical resource (logging messages) is blocked while a
    process is currently accessing it through use of the semaphores.
Access of other functions of the logging utility are blocked by a
    different semaphore.
